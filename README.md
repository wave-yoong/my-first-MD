## What is Chatbot? 

**Conversational Agent**, **Natural Language**, **Human-System Communication**

![Chatbot-Human Communication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/65165c4b014434a39a09cabc8f88e245f710b372/Chatbot-Human%20Communication.png)

Chatbot is a conversational agent that allows computer systems to interact with human users via natural language.
Chatbots are the programs able to respond to users' queries- questions or requests. [^1] This indicates *communication with computer system in natural language*, within the same way as the human-conversation. More inclusive definition explains that chatbot can be labelled to **every software simulating human conversation**. [^2]

## The Path of a Chatbot

### Historical Flow

![Chatbot history](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/65165c4b014434a39a09cabc8f88e245f710b372/Chatbot%20history.png)

The origin of chatbots can be traced back to the "Turing Test," also known as the "imitation game," proposed by Alan Turing. This test evaluated whether a computer could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human, and it is widely regarded as the foundation of modern smart chatbots. [^3]

Building on the Turing Test, the **first chatbot**, *ELIZA*, was developed in 1966 by the MIT AI Research Laboratory. ELIZA was an early natural language processing (NLP) system capable of engaging in simple conversations. Its most famous script, "DOCTOR," simulated a conversation between a doctor (ELIZA) and a patient (the user), allowing users to ask questions within this role-playing context. [^4]
>In this context, ELIZA can be the very beginning history of chatbot persona too.

In 1995, another NLP chatbot was developed called *ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity)*. Although ALICE couldn't pass the Turing Test due to its mechanical nature in short conversations with general users, it won the [Loebner Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loebner_Prize) three times, showcasing its advancements in human-like interaction. [^5]

Text-based chatbots rapidly evolved, and conversational agents were integrated into voice assistants, enabling the creation of personal virtual assistants like Apple's *Siri*. These voice assistants extended beyond smartphones to devices like smart speakers, such as *Alexa*, significantly advancing the smart speaker voice interface market.

Building on these developments, *ChatGPT* emerged, leveraging advancements in Generative AI. Today, users can interact with ChatGPT on a wide range of topics and purposes, including obtaining information, generating images, and receiving emotional support.

### Technical Development Flow & Types of Chatbot

![Chatbot Development_technique](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/65165c4b014434a39a09cabc8f88e245f710b372/Chatbot%20Development_technique.png)

- **FAQ program** chatbot [*Rule-based* chatbot]: Initial chatbot provided prescribed responses based on the determined rules and scenarios. 
    - Users should select simple keywords or sentences provided by the chatbot. 
    - Highly predictable and easy to control
    - This chatbot is able to answer only from the scenarios, so it cannot give unpredicted query asked by users.
    - EX) Reservation chatbot, Government chatbot (e.g., National Science & Technology Information Service, NTIS)[^6]
    ![NTIS Chatbot ND](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fu6ztIDDtsM/sddefault.jpg) 

- **Machine Learning** chatbot: Chatbot algorithm was developed within more complex programming and natural language process.
    - This makes it process more various queries of users. 
    - Machine learning helps chatbot to be exposed to human languages more, and enhances processing of queries and optimization of expectation ability 

- **AI-based** chatbot: With advancements in technology, chatbots began incorporating AI, enabling them to handle more complex conversations.
    - AI chatbots can understand user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
    - Users are no longer restricted to predetermined formats and can freely ask questions, allowing chatbots to achieve *contextual understanding*.
    - However, their performance can vary depending on the quality and diversity of the training data.
    - **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** NLU enables chatbots to interpret the meaning of user inputs, even when they contain minor errors such as typos or ambiguous phrasing. [^7]
    - **Examples:** Personal assistants like *Google Assistant*, consultant services, and AI tutoring chatbots like the English-speaking app *Speak*. [^8]
    ![Google Assistant](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/1f2be024ea05e55ce273e4f410c21a1fb2b3a1ff/hub/2018/05/08/4b33a302-0d8c-4dde-985d-f6a63b6e96fe/google-io-2018-google-assistant-7136.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=1200&width=1200)
    *Google Assistant provides personalized information based on user preferences and interests.*
    ![Speak AI Tutor](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62f37633b878d6371e55ec75/6410a8218c4915651733ef61_speak-gpt4-hero.png)
    *Speak's AI Tutor offers detailed coaching for users to improve their English conversation skills.*

- **Generative AI** chatbot: Generative AI chatbots represent a significant advancement, utilizing deep-learning models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). [^7]
    - These chatbots generate responses based on user interactions and are backed by extensive knowledge bases.
    - Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, the chatbot market has experienced rapid growth.
    - Beyond text generation, generative AI can create multimedia content, including images, music, and videos.
    - This capability allows users to engage with the system more immersively, enhancing both the conversational experience and the satisfaction derived from the results.
    - **Examples:** ChatGPT, Zeta (AI Persona chatbot), NAVER Webtoon character chatbot.
    ![NAVER character chat](https://github.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/blob/main/NAVER%20character%20chat.png?raw=true)
    
        *NAVER release 'character chatbot' from their webtoon service in 2024 with their generative AI 'HyperClovaX'. Users can be one of the characters in the webtoon and communicate with the characters as if they are in the stories.*


    
    > Generative AI fosters the users to be more immersive to the conversation with the chatbot. 
    > Persona gets more power from the technical development, and now users can expect not only 'kind' computer but also 'cynical', 'sardonic' resopnse from the system. 
    
    

- Other types of chatbots
    - **Domain** chatbot [*Business Specialized* chatbot]: optimized chatbot for specific business or service. This can be higher accuracy for the specific domain, but usually these chatbots are rule-based chatbots because of the buisness privacy. 
    ![현대카드 챗봇 예시](https://cdn.apple-economy.com/news/photo/201708/35252_20365_1025.jpg) [^9]
        *Hyundai Card provides its own chatbot in their application. Users can ask some simple questions of customer services, card information etc.*

    - **Hybrid** chatbot: A combination of rule-based and AI-based chatbots, hybrid chatbots handle simple responses using rule-based logic and more complex queries with AI-based processing. 
        - This approach offers both flexibility and control, making it suitable for customer service applications in businesses.
        ![hybrid chatbot](https://tovie.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dialog_003-1024x576.jpg)

    - **Voice-based** chatbot: These chatbots use voice interfaces instead of text, making them more accessible to a broader range of users, including the elderly and people with disabilities.
        - While advancements in technology have improved their accuracy, challenges remain in noisy environments.
        - Prominent examples include Apple's *Siri* and Amazon's *Alexa*. [^7]
        - Many smart speakers, such as KT's *Giga Genie*, now incorporate Voice User Interfaces (VUI) to support vocal interactions.
        ![KT Giga Genie](https://csossihettpx2597658.cdn.gov-ntruss.com/data2/content/image/2021/01/27/.cache/512/20210127500359.jpg)
        
            *When users say "Hey Genie" followed by a request, the speaker responds. Users can ask for the weather, news, top music charts, or general knowledge—typically daily and general information.*


## What are *good* chatbots? 



## What are *bad* chatbots?

Here are some examples of possible bad actions of chatbots:

- Failure to perform human requests well: consequences that do not meet human expectations
- Non-conversational: **out-of-context** story
- Hurt humans by saying things that harm humans
    - cursing, defenselessness, etc
    - an inhumane utterance
    - Biased: racisim, sexist speech, etc

Ex) Lee Luda in South Korea(2021)
