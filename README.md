## What is Chatbot? 

**Conversational Agent**, **Natural Language**, **Human-System Communication**

![Chatbot-Human Communication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/65165c4b014434a39a09cabc8f88e245f710b372/Chatbot-Human%20Communication.png)

Chatbot is a conversational agent that allows computer systems to interact with human users via natural language.
Chatbots are the programs able to respond to users' queries- questions or requests. [^1] This indicates *communication with computer system in natural language*, within the same way as the human-conversation. More inclusive definition explains that chatbot can be labelled to **every software simulating human conversation**. [^2]

## The Path of a Chatbot

### Historical Flow

![Chatbot history](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/65165c4b014434a39a09cabc8f88e245f710b372/Chatbot%20history.png)

The origin of chatbots can be traced back to the "Turing Test," also known as the "imitation game," proposed by Alan Turing. This test evaluated whether a computer could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human, and it is widely regarded as the foundation of modern smart chatbots. [^3]

Building on the Turing Test, the **first chatbot**, *ELIZA*, was developed in 1966 by the MIT AI Research Laboratory. ELIZA was an early natural language processing (NLP) system capable of engaging in simple conversations. Its most famous script, "DOCTOR," simulated a conversation between a doctor (ELIZA) and a patient (the user), allowing users to ask questions within this role-playing context. [^4]
>In this context, ELIZA can be the very beginning history of chatbot persona too.

In 1995, another NLP chatbot was developed called *ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity)*. Although ALICE couldn't pass the Turing Test due to its mechanical nature in short conversations with general users, it won the [Loebner Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loebner_Prize) three times, showcasing its advancements in human-like interaction. [^5]

Text-based chatbots rapidly evolved, and conversational agents were integrated into voice assistants, enabling the creation of personal virtual assistants like Apple's *Siri*. These voice assistants extended beyond smartphones to devices like smart speakers, such as *Alexa*, significantly advancing the smart speaker voice interface market.

Building on these developments, *ChatGPT* emerged, leveraging advancements in Generative AI. Today, users can interact with ChatGPT on a wide range of topics and purposes, including obtaining information, generating images, and receiving emotional support.

### Technical Development Flow & Types of Chatbot

![Chatbot Development_technique](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/65165c4b014434a39a09cabc8f88e245f710b372/Chatbot%20Development_technique.png)

- FAQ program chatbot: Initial chatbot provided limited response 

## Types of Chatbot 

**Rule-based Chatbot**

- Operated by prescribed rules and scenarios 
- Only give answers when users click "menu" button or enter specific keywords
- (+): predictable, easy control
- (-): cannot answer to the complex questions
- ex) Reservation Chatbot, NTIS Chatbot [^3]

**AI-based Chatbot**

- Understanding users' queries with natural language processing(NLP)
- ChatGPT, Siri, Google Assistant
- (+): contextual understanding, natural conversation
- (-): difference in performance within the training data
- ex) Personal assistant, consultant service, tutoring chatbot [^4]

![Google Assistant](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/1f2be024ea05e55ce273e4f410c21a1fb2b3a1ff/hub/2018/05/08/4b33a302-0d8c-4dde-985d-f6a63b6e96fe/google-io-2018-google-assistant-7136.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=1200&width=1200)

3. Business Specialized Chatbot (Domain Chatbot)

- Optimized chatbot for specific business or service
- Shopping assistant, bank consulting chatbot, Hospital reservation chatbot
- (+): Higher accuracy for the specific domain
- (-): Limited to be applied to other domains

4. Hybrid Chatbot 

- Rule-based + AI-based mixture [^6]
- Simple responses are treated by rule-based, AI-based respond to complicated questions 
- (+): can receive both control & flexibility
- ex) Customer Response services in Business

5. Voice-based Chatbot

- conversation with voice rather than text
- (+): hands-free interaction
- (-): accuracy cannot be assured in the noise
- ex) Siri, Alexa [^7]

    - an inhumane utterance
    - Biased: racisim, sexist speech, etc

Ex) Lee Luda in South Korea(2021)
