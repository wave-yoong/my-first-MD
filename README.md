## What is Chatbot? 

**Conversational Agent**, **Natural Language**, **Human-System Communication**

![Chatbot-Human Communication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/65165c4b014434a39a09cabc8f88e245f710b372/Chatbot-Human%20Communication.png)

Chatbot is a conversational agent that allows computer systems to interact with human users via natural language.
Chatbots are the programs able to respond to users' queries- questions or requests. [^1] This indicates *communication with computer system in natural language*, within the same way as the human-conversation. More inclusive definition explains that chatbot can be labelled to **every software simulating human conversation**. [^2]

## The Path of a Chatbot

### Historical Flow

![Chatbot history](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/65165c4b014434a39a09cabc8f88e245f710b372/Chatbot%20history.png)

The origin of chatbots can be traced back to the "Turing Test," also known as the "imitation game," proposed by Alan Turing. This test evaluated whether a computer could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human, and it is widely regarded as the foundation of modern smart chatbots. [^3]

Building on the Turing Test, the **first chatbot**, *ELIZA*, was developed in 1966 by the MIT AI Research Laboratory. ELIZA was an early natural language processing (NLP) system capable of engaging in simple conversations. Its most famous script, "DOCTOR," simulated a conversation between a doctor (ELIZA) and a patient (the user), allowing users to ask questions within this role-playing context. [^4]


>In this context, ELIZA can be the very beginning history of chatbot persona too.

In 1995, another NLP chatbot was developed called *ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity)*. Although ALICE couldn't pass the Turing Test due to its mechanical nature in short conversations with general users, it won the [Loebner Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loebner_Prize) three times, showcasing its advancements in human-like interaction. [^5]

Text-based chatbots rapidly evolved, and conversational agents were integrated into voice assistants, enabling the creation of personal virtual assistants like Apple's *Siri*. These voice assistants extended beyond smartphones to devices like smart speakers, such as *Alexa*, significantly advancing the smart speaker voice interface market.

Building on these developments, *ChatGPT* emerged, leveraging advancements in Generative AI. Today, users can interact with ChatGPT on a wide range of topics and purposes, including obtaining information, generating images, and receiving emotional support.

- **FAQ program** chatbot [*Rule-based* chatbot]: Initial chatbot provided prescribed responses based on the determined rules and scenarios. 
    - Users should select simple keywords or sentences provided by the chatbot. 
    - Highly predictable and easy to control
    - This chatbot is able to answer only from the scenarios, so it cannot give unpredicted query asked by users.
    - EX) Reservation chatbot, Government chatbot (e.g., National Science & Technology Information Service, NTIS)[^6]
    
    ![NTIS Chatbot ND](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fu6ztIDDtsM/sddefault.jpg) 

- **Machine Learning** chatbot: Chatbot algorithm was developed within more complex programming and natural language process.
    - This makes it process more various queries of users. 
    - Machine learning helps chatbot to be exposed to human languages more, and enhances processing of queries and optimization of expectation ability 

- **AI-based** chatbot: With advancements in technology, chatbots began incorporating AI, enabling them to handle more complex conversations.
    - AI chatbots can understand user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
    - Users are no longer restricted to predetermined formats and can freely ask questions, allowing chatbots to achieve *contextual understanding*.
    - However, their performance can vary depending on the quality and diversity of the training data.
    - **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** NLU enables chatbots to interpret the meaning of user inputs, even when they contain minor errors such as typos or ambiguous phrasing. [^7]
    - **Examples:** Personal assistants like *Google Assistant*, consultant services, and AI tutoring chatbots like the English-speaking app *Speak*. [^8]
    ![Google Assistant](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/1f2be024ea05e55ce273e4f410c21a1fb2b3a1ff/hub/2018/05/08/4b33a302-0d8c-4dde-985d-f6a63b6e96fe/google-io-2018-google-assistant-7136.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=1200&width=1200)
    *Google Assistant provides personalized information based on user preferences and interests.*
    ![Speak AI Tutor](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62f37633b878d6371e55ec75/6410a8218c4915651733ef61_speak-gpt4-hero.png)
    *Speak's AI Tutor offers detailed coaching for users to improve their English conversation skills.*

- **Generative AI** chatbot: Generative AI chatbots represent a significant advancement, utilizing deep-learning models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). [^7]
    - These chatbots generate responses based on user interactions and are backed by extensive knowledge bases.
    - Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, the chatbot market has experienced rapid growth.
    - Beyond text generation, generative AI can create multimedia content, including images, music, and videos.
    - This capability allows users to engage with the system more immersively, enhancing both the conversational experience and the satisfaction derived from the results.
    - **Examples:** ChatGPT, Zeta (AI Persona chatbot), NAVER Webtoon character chatbot.
    ![NAVER character chat](https://github.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/blob/main/NAVER%20character%20chat.png?raw=true)
    
        *NAVER release 'character chatbot' from their webtoon service in 2024 with their generative AI 'HyperClovaX'. Users can be one of the characters in the webtoon and communicate with the characters as if they are in the stories.*


    
    > Generative AI fosters the users to be more immersive to the conversation with the chatbot. 
    > Persona gets more power from the technical development, and now users can expect not only 'kind' computer but also 'cynical', 'sardonic' resopnse from the system. 
    
    

- Other types of chatbots
    - **Domain** chatbot [*Business Specialized* chatbot]: optimized chatbot for specific business or service. This can be higher accuracy for the specific domain, but usually these chatbots are rule-based chatbots because of the buisness privacy. [^9]
    ![현대카드 챗봇 예시](https://github.com/wave-yoong/my-first-MD/blob/main/Hyundai%20card%20chatbot.png?raw=true)
        
        
        *Hyundai Card provides its own chatbot in their application. Users can ask some simple questions of customer services, or get some information about the card product or related notices.*

    - **Hybrid** chatbot: A combination of rule-based and AI-based chatbots, hybrid chatbots handle simple responses using rule-based logic and more complex queries with AI-based processing. [^10]
        - This approach offers both flexibility and control, making it suitable for customer service applications in businesses.
        ![hybrid chatbot](https://tovie.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dialog_003-1024x576.jpg)

    - **Voice-based** chatbot: These chatbots use voice interfaces instead of text, making them more accessible to a broader range of users, including the elderly and people with disabilities.
        - While advancements in technology have improved their accuracy, challenges remain in noisy environments.
        - Prominent examples include Apple's *Siri* and Amazon's *Alexa*. [^11]
        - Many smart speakers, such as KT's *Giga Genie*, now incorporate Voice User Interfaces (VUI) to support vocal interactions.
        ![KT Giga Genie](https://csossihettpx2597658.cdn.gov-ntruss.com/data2/content/image/2021/01/27/.cache/512/20210127500359.jpg)
        
            *When users say "Hey Genie" followed by a request, the speaker responds. Users can ask for the weather, news, top music charts, or general knowledge—typically daily and general information.*


## What are *good* chatbots? 
A good chatbot is one that **effectively understands user queries, provides accurate and helpful responses, and can handle a range of conversational scenarios**. Key features include natural language understanding, context retention, omnichannel support, and the ability to integrate with existing systems. Additionally, a good chatbot should be able to learn from interactions and improve its performance over time. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown of what makes a good chatbot [^12][^13]:
1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: A good chatbot needs to be able to understand the nuances of human language, including different ways of asking the same question, slang, and slang terms. 
2. **Context Retention**: It should remember previous turns in a conversation and use that context to provide more relevant and accurate responses. 
3. **Omnichannel** Support: The chatbot should be able to handle conversations across multiple channels, such as websites, mobile apps, social media, and messaging platforms. 
4. **Seamless Integration**: It should integrate smoothly with existing systems and databases, allowing it to access and update information as needed. 
5. **Learning and Improvement**: A good chatbot should be able to learn from its interactions with users and improve its performance over time. 
6. **Helpful and Accurate** Responses: It should provide users with accurate and helpful information, addressing their queries effectively. 
7. **Clear and Engaging** Communication: The chatbot should communicate in a way that is clear, engaging, and easy to understand, avoiding jargon or technical terms. 
8. **Proactive** Engagement: A good chatbot can proactively engage users, offering assistance or information when it's needed. 
9. **User-Friendly** Interface: The chatbot's interface should be easy to use and navigate, allowing users to interact with it without frustration. 
10. **Live Agent Handoff**: In cases where the chatbot cannot answer a user's query, it should be able to seamlessly hand off the conversation to a live agent. 


>The essential quality of good chatbots is their ability to provide **timely responses, an appropriate tone and manner, and relevant content (output)** based on user queries (input).

>This varies depending on the context and purpose of the chatbot. For *practical and utilitarian* use, it is crucial to deliver accurate information or actionable advice promptly. Conversely, for *hedonic and social* use, users expect chatbots to offer emotional support or engage in conversations tailored to their preferences, rather than merely providing factual information. Therefore, it is vital for chatbot algorithms to **understand the user's context** and adapt their mode of interaction accordingly.

## What are *bad* chatbots?

The rush to implement the technologies has led to numerous *bad chatbot examples* that highlight the importance of careful development and deployment. These chatbot fails can stem from a variety of issues, including **lack of understanding of customer needs, insufficient testing, or a failure to integrate human-like interaction**. [^14]

1. The **Inarticulate assistant**
One of the most common bad chatbot examples is the inarticulate assistant, which fails to understand user queries, providing irrelevant or nonsensical responses. This often stems from inadequate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities or insufficient training data.

2. The **Overly scripted bot**
Another frequent issue is the overly scripted bot, unable to deviate from preset dialogues. This inflexibility can frustrate users, especially when they attempt to ask questions outside of the chatbot’s programmed scope.

3. The **impersonal communicator**
Chatbots that lack a personal touch often leave users feeling undervalued. Effective customer service requires bots to recognise returning users and personalise interactions, a feature often missing in poorly designed chatbots.

4. The **security blunder**
Security is a paramount concern, and chatbots that mishandle sensitive information are serious liabilities. There have been reported cases where chatbots inadvertently exposed personal data, highlighting a critical need for robust security measures.

5. The **feedback ignorer**
In customer service, feedback is golden. Some chatbots, however, fail to log interactions or solicit customer feedback, making it challenging for businesses to improve their services based on user experiences.

6. The **connectivity failure**
Some chatbots are plagued by connectivity issues, causing frequent crashes or unresponsiveness. These technical failures significantly detract from user experience and can damage brand reputation.

7. The **language barrier**
Chatbots deployed in multilingual contexts often struggle to deliver consistent service across languages, resulting in confused and frustrated users.

8. The **Harmful Expression**
Some chatbots have been released with training data that contained biases, leading to responses that were racist, sexist, or otherwise inappropriate. Additionally, chatbots that use cursing, exhibit defensiveness, or make inhumane utterances can harm users and damage trust. A notable example is [Lee Luda in South Korea](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/255964/20210114/south-korea-ai-chatbot-gets-suspended-facebook-abusive-insulting-comments.htm), a chatbot suspended in 2021 for making offensive and discriminatory comments. This case highlights the critical importance of ethical training and robust content moderation in chatbot development.

![Lee Luda chatbot](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350957710/figure/fig1/AS:1041250954256384@1625264981005/Lee-Luda-a-Korean-AI-chatbot-has-been-pulled-after-inappropriate-dialogues-such-as.ppm)


> In my experience, a *bad chatbot* or *annoying chatbot* often fails to meet user expectations by providing irrelevant or unhelpful responses. For instance, despite advancements in generative AI, ChatGPT sometimes struggles to provide reliable academic references. It may suggest *dead links* or *irrelevant papers*, which can lead to frustration and diminish the user experience.
